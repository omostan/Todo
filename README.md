# A Simple Todo List

Some times you may need to keep track of your agender for the day or just keep track of your execution plan for your next project. This simple todo list is very handy in such scenarios.

You can mark completed items, add or remove items from the list.
<p>
    <i>
<b>Note:</b><br />
The archive and the trash buttons will remove all marked items on the list while the trash icon on each item will remove that item only. The trash icon on each item will only appear if an item is marked.
